The Impact of Mountaintop Removal Mining on an Aquatic Indicator Species within Appalachia
Mountaintop removal mining is the process whereby the summits of mountains are blown away in order to extract coal. Infamously practiced in Appalachia, it is an incredibly damaging form of mining that irreparably alters the face of the landscape, and greatly pollutes the streams and rivers found throughout the region (Griffith et al., 2012). They also are notorious for the practice of dumping waste rock in valleys adjacent to the mining site, burying them and the headwaters of many streams (Miller et al., 2014). Exploring data that examines the population and health trends of an indicator species within the region (such as salamanders) would allow us to quantitatively measure the damage that mountaintop removal mining causes the ecosystem. We can then use this to offer proposals to mitigate the destruction that it causes.
I would like to examine how mountaintop removal mining affects the physical measurement data and/or population statistics for a selected aquatic indicator species. 
The statistics for the species would be measured before, during, and after the mountaintop removal process was completed for a specific mine within the range of a known population of the indicator species. I would expect to find that the population of the indicator species declines during the mining process, with a light uptick in population afterwards. Health statistics for the species should also follow a similar trend. I could try finding data regarding pollution statistics on the EPA’s National Emissions Inventory database. As for indicator species data, I could look at survey data conducted by state-specific wildlife and natural resources data. The scope of the project would be over decades, as that is how long these mining sites typically last in duration, and would focus primarily on a selected waterway affected by the mining in the region. Some statistical tests we could run to examine our data could be p-value tests, t-tests, and z-tests.
We expect that the physical measurement data would show decreased measurements amongst the salamanders, indicating hindered growth due to pollution. When referring to population data, we also expect to see a decrease in population because of pollution. Using this data, we can learn how to better manage mountaintop removal sites.

Difference in Biodiversity between Clearcut and Old Growth Stands in Tongass National Forest 
The Tongass National Forest contains some of the largest tracts of old growth temperate rainforests left on Earth. Holding the title of the largest National Forest in America (DellaSala et al., 2022), it is an important carbon sink and is an incredibly productive ecosystem, housing bountiful salmon runs as well as dense Northern Pacific coastal rainforest. For decades, however, the demand for its rich timber stands (such as sitka spruce) have resulted in portions of the forest becoming deforested. This logging poses a variety of challenges to the wildlife of the Tongass. The fragmented nature of the Tongass, owing to its spread over the hundreds of islands in the Alexander Archipelago, make habitat fragmentation resulting from logging a much more dire issue than logging on the mainland (Smith et al., 2023). We want to examine the effects of clearcutting on the biodiversity of these Northern Pacific coastal rainforests and determine what policy changes should be made to ensure that environmental restoration is done well.
Formerly clearcut sections of the Tongass National Forest have less biodiversity that old growth sections.
A way we can carry out our study would be by comparing the species diversity between clearcut and old growth stands, which could be found under survey data conducted by the USFS or the Alaska Fish and Game agency. We can also search for data through CEOS for aboveground biomass statistics and measure the difference between biomass of clearcut areas and biomass of old growth areas. This study could involve measures taken of clearcut sections five years, ten years, and then twenty years after logging operations were conducted. Ideally, getting a diverse ensemble of logged sites and adjacent old growth sites would ensure that our data collected is as robust as possible. It wouldn’t be feasible to measure every logged site, however, so twenty could be a good number to work with. Some statistical tests we could run to examine the validity of our data could be p-value tests, t-tests, and z-tests.
We expect to find that both species diversity and aboveground biomass in formerly clearcut sections of forest to be lower than those in old growth forests. Using this data, we can explore how to better conserve these impressive forests and how to improve their regeneration.

The Importance of Biotextiles in a Circular Fashion Industry
Within the past decade, there has been growing awareness of the environmental impact of the fashion industry, particularly its wastefulness and contribution to pollution. The industry is responsible for approximately 10% of global carbon emissions and produces vast amounts of non-biodegradable waste (Niinimäki et al., 2020). Biotextiles–fabrics made from biodegradable materials such as fungi, algae, and cellulose–offer a promising solution to these issues by reducing the persistence of textile waste in landfills and minimizing harmful environmental impacts. Unlike synthetic textiles, which can take hundreds of years to degrade, biotextiles are designed to break down naturally, contributing to a circular fashion economy (Bhuptani et al., 2021). Advances in bio-based fibers, such as bacterial cellulose, are revolutionizing the textile industry by providing materials that decompose rapidly while maintaining desirable qualities of durability and strength (The Fiber Journal, 2021). This study will explore the key factors that influence the environmental impact of biotextiles, including degradation rates, greenhouse gas emissions, in order to assess their potential as sustainable alternatives to conventional textiles.
The goal of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of various biotextiles by analyzing their degradation rates and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The primary research question is: which biotextile material degrades the fastest and produces the least greenhouse gas emissions?
The dataset provides an overview of the key aspects of biobased textile fibers, including environmental impacts such as degradation rates and greenhouse gas emissions. This study will leverage this data to compare the biodegradability and environmental footprints of various biotextiles. Specifically, we will focus on cellulose-based biotextiles, mycelium, and bacterial cellulose as the primary materials for comparison. We will apply statistical analysis to examine the degradation rates over different timeframes (e.g., 6 months, 1 year, 3 years) for each biotextile. Additionally, we will analyze the greenhouse gas emissions produced by these materials during the manufacturing process and decomposition stages. Data sources include laboratory degradation tests, emissions data, and lifecycle assessments available within the dataset. The scope of this study will be limited to biotextiles manufactured and tested within controlled environments (temperature, humidity) to isolate the effects of each material. Statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis will be employed to evaluate the differences between biotextiles in terms of their degradation rates and emissions.
We expect to find that cellulose-based biotextiles degrade more quickly and generate fewer greenhouse gases during their lifecycle compared to other alternatives. This finding would highlight cellulose as the most sustainable option for a circular fashion industry. Moreover, the study could provide insight into optimizing the manufacturing and disposal processes of biotextiles to further reduce their environmental impact. The outcomes of this study are important as they could influence the adoption of more sustainable materials within the fashion industry, thereby contributing to a reduction in textile waste and greenhouse gas emissions.

Using Big Data to optimize Human well-being and Quality of life.
The integration of big data analytics into public health has the potential to revolutionize our understanding and enhancement of human well-being. The Colorado Well-Being Index, developed by Gallup-Healthways, offers a comprehensive daily assessment of residents' health and happiness, encompassing various dimensions such as physical health, emotional well-being, work environment, and community engagement. Analyzing this dataset can uncover patterns and correlations that inform policies and initiatives aimed at improving quality of life. For instance, studies have demonstrated that big data can generate high-quality scientific evidence, influencing public health policy formulation (Khoury & Ioannidis, 2015). Moreover, leveraging big data allows for the development of diagnostic tests and therapeutic strategies, enhancing overall public health outcomes (OECD, 2016).​
To analyze the Colorado Well-Being Index dataset to identify key factors influencing residents' well-being and quality of life, and to develop predictive models for well-being based on demographic and socioeconomic variables.​ What demographic and socioeconomic factors most significantly impact the well-being and quality of life of Colorado residents, and how can big data analytics be utilized to predict and enhance these outcomes?​
This study will use the Colorado Well-Being Index dataset, which includes data on physical health, emotional health, social and community factors, financial security, and more. Supplementary demographic and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau will be incorporated to enhance the analysis. The study will focus on statewide data from Colorado over the past five years. Descriptive statistics will summarize well-being scores across demographic groups, and multivariate regression analysis will identify significant predictors of well-being. Additionally, predictive models, such as decision trees and random forests, will be used to forecast well-being scores based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors.
I predict that the analysis will reveal significant correlations between certain demographic and socioeconomic factors and higher well-being scores. For example, higher income levels, higher education attainment, and active community engagement may be associated with improved well-being. The predictive models developed could serve as tools for policymakers and public health officials to identify at-risk populations and tailor interventions aimed at enhancing quality of life. Ultimately, this study aims to demonstrate how big data analytics can inform evidence-based strategies to optimize human well-being and quality of life.​
